# Task 
AI Solution design, dev and deployment on AWS

 

Objective:

 

Create a project in github or bitbucket (code.hidglobal.com) that has following pieces/components -

 

a) Backend [written in your language of choice]

b) Frontend [You can copy the one from session-7]

c) AWS Cognito for authentication

d) CDK for deployment

e) DevContainer based setup

 

Share your repo URL in the channel when done

 

##

 

Cognito

Should restrict domain names to hidglobal or assabloy for signup
You would use AWS Lambda to verify that
Deploy it via CDK
 

Backend

 

Your backend must expose at least 1 private endpoint along with some public endpoints
Requires some configuration
Use AWS Parameter Store for this
Requires some secret keys (think of API key for some other service that backend invokes)
Uses AWS Secret Manager for this
The private endpoints use JWT idToken generated by AWS Cognito
Must be able to run it locally with out any dependence on AWS Services except for AWS Cognito
Deploy it as an AWS AppRunner service
You are free to chose the language and framework
Deploy it using CDK
Frontend

You can write from scratch if familiar with React or use the one from Session 7
You must find a way to dynamically update aws-exports.ts file for all details related to AWS cognito
Hint - Mustache 
Deploy it using CDK
Extra credit -
Invoke one of the protected backend endpoint from the page
As you can see we have covered all of the above in various sessions. 

The exercise is an open book; you can seek help from any resource.


If you do this project, you will notice following - 

Getting all this components working will identify some gaps that you have
Pain/frustrations are features not bugs
You will have a good template for your next big project 
Seeing the result of time you have spent so far as part of these sessions 
BTW Thank you for trusting and giving me time to share all this with you
A sense of accomplishment
Love from me <-- this is what you should really aim for ðŸ™‚ 

# Running the example

## Users

Need to create a pool of users for our app

### Web Portal 
Cognito->Create user pool
on left "Users" then "Create User"

(Note email should be unique for that user pool)



### Change password via cmd line

```bash
aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password \
  --user-pool-id us-east-1_eJg72xFLu \
  --username whatever@gmail.com \
  --password Password123! \
  --permanent
```


## Frontend

Running the frontend 

```sh
cd milestone01\frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
